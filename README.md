# CSE-240-Projects
My projects I completed taking CSE 240 at Arizona State University

These are all the homework/coding assignments I had for CSE 240, Intro to Programming Languages, with Professor Janaka Balasooriya. Each .zip file is a different assignment.
The course covers C, C++, Prolog, and Scheme. 

Assignments 1-8 are written in C, Assignments 9 and 10 are written in C++

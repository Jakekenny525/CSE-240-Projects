# CSE-240-Projects
My projects I completed taking CSE 240 at Arizona State University

These are all the homework/coding assignments I had for CSE 240, Intro to Programming Languages, with Professor Janaka Balasooriya. Each .zip file is a different assignment. With the exception of homework 1, all assignments are labeled as follows: Kenny_Jacob[Assignment #]. 
The course covers C, C++, Scheme, and Prolog. 

Assignments 1-8 are written in C, Assignments 9 and 10 are written in C++, Assignments 11 and 12 (as well as the extra credit assignment) are written in Scheme, and Assignment 13 is written in Prolog.
